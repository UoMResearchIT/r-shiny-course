# Getting started with Shiny

## Creating a Shiny app

The most straightforward way of creating a new Shiny app is to use R Studio.  From the menu, choose, File, New, Shiny Web App.  

Choose a suitable name for your app (e.g. "gapminder").   Leave the other options as their defaults ("Single File", and Create within directory: `~/mawdsley`).  [git:01_defaultapp](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/r-shiny-course-materials/commit/630e15f29031d4ac180423251fd8324e36ee9a2f)

{{% notice info %}}
When we create a new Shiny app we can create a single file (`app.R`), or as two separate files (`ui.R` and `server.R`).   The latter format used to be the only method of defining an Shiny app, but can still be useful when building a more complicated app, as it allows us to separate the user interface (`ui.R`) from the server logic (`server.R`).  As we will be building a relatively small app, we'll use the single file approach.

When we create a new Shiny app in R Studio, it creates an example app that allows us to alter the number of bins in a histogram.  This uses an example data-set that is provided with R of the waiting times for the eruption of the "Old Faithful" geyser.

We can run the app by pressing the "Run App" button in the tool-bar (or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter).  This will launch an browser window within R Studio where we can interact with our app.

There is a cheat sheet for Shiny included with R Studio.  This can be accessed from the menu: Help, Cheatsheets, Web Applications with shiny.

## Loading our libraries and functions

The default app doesn't use any additional libraries, functions or external data.  Before going any further we'll add these to the example app.

The working directory of your R session is probably the project's directory (i.e. `~/mawdsley` - this is displayed at the top of the console window).  When you run the app, it runs in its own working directory (e.g. `~/myworkshop/gapminder`).   If you're interactively running bits of your code you may find it helpful to set the working directory to your app's directory. You can do this by typing `setwd("~/myworkshop/gapminder")`

### Exercise

* Copy the `gapminder.rds` and `workshopFunctions.R` files into your app directory.
* load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries at the start of the app
* Modify the app to load the `gapminder.rds` into an object called `gapminder` using the `readRDS()` function
* `source()` the `workshopFunctions.R` file in the app to make the functions available to the app
* Check your app still works - the output will be unchanged at this stage, but if there are any errors loading the functions or data you will see these in RStudio's console window.

You may wish to look at the `codeExample.R` file, which contains examples of loading libraries and functions
