This site is for Research IT's Introduction to Shiny course.  It is based on a workshop that was given at the [RSE 2018 conference](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/). It is written by [David Mawdsley](https://github.com/mawds), with help from [Joshua Woodcock](https://github.com/Josh-Woodcock) and [Louise Lever](https://github.com/louiselever), who are all [Research Software Engineers](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk).  Thanks to [Christopher Woods](http://chryswoods.com/) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk) for his mentoring and comments, and to [Gerard Capes](https://github.com/gcapes) and [Ann Gledson](https://github.com/AnnAnnFryingPan) for beta testing the course.

This site is written using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the [learn theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/), and hosted on [github](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/RSE18-shiny-workshop).
