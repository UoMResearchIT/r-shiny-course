## Introduction to Shiny
- Shiny lets us easily and quickly build web apps using R
- Can use pretty much any output from R within our app
- And control it using widgets
<p>
For example:
- [Trafford Data Lab Ward Profiles](https://trafforddatalab.shinyapps.io/ward_profiler/)
- [Movie explorer](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html)
- [Bus dashboard](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/bus-dashboard.html)
- [PK modelling](http://shiny.webpopix.org/dashboard/pkmodel/)  
<p>
- [Shiny gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)
  
## Why (not?) use Shiny

- Fast to develop
- Use R's libraries easily
    -including e.g. leaflet for mapping 
- Many built in widgets
    - And packages for others
<p>
- Awkward to scale
- Non-free pro version needed for some server features

## [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org)

## Workshop Aims

- To use Shiny to make an interactive plot
    - Select / animate the year
    - Only plot data for selected continents
    - Deploy the app to shinyapps.io
    - (Possible extensions included in "going further")

## Getting started 

* The course builds on a single worked example.
* Download the [zip file](https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/r-shiny-course/raw/master/runningExample.zip)
* Decompress this to a directory within `C:\work`
* Each step is separate labelled folder, which is cross referenced in the notes, e.g. [git:01_defaultapp]().

* The course website https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-shiny-course/ contains all the exercises, links to solutions and more detail than these slides. 
  
## Interactive exercises with git

If you're happy using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/UoMResearchIT/r-shiny-course-materials.git
```

* Solutions are stored as tagged commits.
    * e.g [git:01_defaultapp]() 
    * Link takes you to github's commit page
    * Checkout versions with `git checkout 01_defaultapp`

* Make your own Shiny app in another directory
 
## Getting started (2)

* Run rstudio:

```
rstudio
```

* We'll make a new project for our app
  	* Make this in `C:/work` and copy to your P drive at the end of the course
	* When we make a Shiny Web Application project, we get a simple Shiny app for free.


## Getting started (3)

* Copy the following files from the zip file to your project directory:
	* `gapminder.rds` contains the gapminder data
	* `workshopFunctions.R` contains the functions we will use.
	    * These are mostly to make it easier to make the plots, and to avoid this turning into a ggplot workshop.
	* `codeExample.R` shows how to use the plotting functions.
  
* Run App using the toolbar or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Anatomy of a Shiny App - user interface

```
ui <- fluidPage(
    
    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    
    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins", ...
        ),
        
        
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

`input$bins` is a source

`output$distPlot` is an endpoint

## Anatomy of a Shiny App - server
```
server <- function(input, output) {
    
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2] 
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
        
        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}

```

Shiny handles the dependencies between sources and endpoints, and only updates what is needed - Reactive programming. 

## Exercise - getting ready for the rest of the course.

* Copy the gapminder data (`gapminder.rds`) and `workshopFunctions.R` to your app directory
* Modify the app to load the ggplot2 and dplyr libraries, gapminder data, and `workshopFunctions.R` 

* Check your app still works

[git:02_loaddata]()

(Course notes: [Getting started](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-shiny-course/basics/))

## More widgets

- Many common widget types are built into Shiny see:
    https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html 
- Can be extended using additional packages (e.g. https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets)
- [or by writing your own](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/building-inputs.html).
  

## Exercise

- Add a `checkboxGroupInput()` widget to select the continents we wish to display on the graph
- Change the title of the app in `titlePanel()` to something sensible

(This won't do anything yet - we'll connect it to the graph shortly)

[git:03_continentwidget]()

(Course notes: [User interface design](https://uomresearchit.github.io/ui/))

## Exercises - Putting it all together

- Replace the histogram with a gapminder plot, using `produceGapminderPlot()` [git:04_gapminderplot]()
  - See `codeExample.R`
- Replace the bins widget with a widget to select the year [git:05_yearwidget]()
- Use the outputs of the widgets to make the graph interactive [git:06_interactive]()

(Course notes: [Putting it all together](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-shiny-course/together/))

## Deploying Shiny apps

- Run from R(Studio)

- https://shinyapps.io 
    - Easy deployment from RStudio
    - Various pricing tiers (inc. free)
- Shiny server
    - Free and commercial versions
    - Authentication requires commercial version
    
(Course notes: [Deploying Shiny apps](https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-shiny-course/deploy/))

## Summary

- Define the UI and server functions
- Reactive programming handles the depencencies between elements
- Deploy apps using shinyapps.io or to a Shiny Server


## Extra Slides


    
## App layout

- The default apps `sidebarLayout()` is a good starting point.
- The `fluidPage()` layout gives us more control.

```{r, echo = TRUE,  eval = FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Gapminder visualisation"), # Will cover whole width
  plotOutput("gapminderPlot", click = "plotClick"), # Ditto
  fluidRow( 
    column(6, # column width
           sliderInput(inputId = "year", ....) # Things to include in the column
    ),
    column(6, # Next column
           checkboxGroupInput("continent", ....)# Things to include in second column
    )
  )
)
```

- The widths of each row of columns should sum to 12 [git:15_layout]()
